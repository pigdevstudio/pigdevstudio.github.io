Ever since I understood that games are systems of incentives and everything, from the visual effects to their economies, should be designed to guide players toward a desired experience, I got obsessed with understanding the human mind and how it reacts to incentives.</p><h1>Games and Prototypes</h1><p>I use games to test and try the knowledge I’m gathering through my journey. They are my lab, where I test if my concepts and hypotheses will work in reality.</p><h2>Moon Cheeser</h2><p>A game about a mouse that discovered that the moon is made out of cheese.</p><p>On Moon Cheeser, players collect cheese crumbs to spend on skins and unlock new levels.</p><p>The game’s core loop is:</p><ol><li>Throw comets on the moon to create cheese crumbs</li><li>Collect the cheese crumbs to unlock new skins and features</li><li>Use the new features to improve the ability to gather more cheese</li><li>Repeat</li></ol><p>Use the button below to play a demo version of the game available on <a href="http://itch.io">itch.io</a>.</p><p class="align-center"></p><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="552" height="167" frameborder="0" src="https://itch.io/embed/73431?bg_color=322947&amp;fg_color=ffe478&amp;link_color=eb564b&amp;border_color=5b5270"><a href="https://pigdev.itch.io/moon-cheeser">Moon Cheeser by Pigdev, Henrique Campos</a></iframe></div><p>Moon Cheeser was my first project and I used it mainly to test out my ability to create interesting but simple core loops. This version in particular is not the most up to date one. The most recent version was available on Play Store. After Android updates, I decided to drop support for the game.</p><p>I also used Moon Cheeser to implement and integrate features from Loot Locker, especially in-app purchases, you can check out the sponsored series through the video below:</p><p class="align-center"></p><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DEy__kLh1Vc?si=BGpB7Vc2G4Q8XuyY&amp;controls=0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div><h2>Fermi Parallax</h2><p>In ufology, there’s a theory known as Fermi Paradox where scientist Enrico Fermi pointed out the discrepancy between the lack of conclusive evidence of advanced extraterrestrial life and the apparent likelihood of its existence. Based on that, I created a vertical space shooting game where players transverse some examples of what Fermi called “Big Filters”, which are possible causes that may prevent advanced civilizations from interacting with each other.</p><p>The game’s core loop is:</p><ol><li>Defeat the current wave of enemies</li><li>Unlock new parts of the narrative</li><li>Overcome a Big Filter</li></ol><p>Use the button below to play a demo version of the game available on <a href="http://itch.io">itch.io</a>.</p><p class="align-center"></p><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="552" height="167" frameborder="0" src="https://itch.io/embed/746487?bg_color=322947&amp;fg_color=ffffff&amp;link_color=4da6ff&amp;border_color=5b5270"><a href="https://pigdev.itch.io/fermi-parallax">Fermi Parallax by Pigdev</a></iframe></div><p>In Fermi Parallax, a wordplay with the parallax effect yet another inspiration, I wanted to test my ability to turn a concept into a game. My main inspiration for the game was the famous science YouTube channel Kurzgesagt’s <em>The Fermi Paradox - Where Are All The Aliens?</em> video.</p><p class="align-center"></p><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sNhhvQGsMEc?si=VT-1VACxX0Bnfzn9" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div><h2>Sunset</h2><p>One of my core beliefs as a game designer is that I express myself through games. I never understood why people imbued a negative connotation to games, as in “are you playing games with me” or “is this a game to you”. I see politics, the economy, cooking, shopping, and professional and personal relationships through the lens of games, as systems of incentives toward a goal.</p><p>In 2021 I met the only person who understood that and wanted to play with me. She was amazing. We were at a park and she said</p><blockquote><p>Let’s play a game? Whoever guess the time when the sun will set, wins!</p></blockquote><p>We spent the sunset drinking and laughing. I won, by the way. But I also wanted to use this concept and turn it into a real, digital game.</p><p>Sunset is a game inspired by this memory, which I keep deep in my heart. The core loop is:</p><ol><li>Get a sunset guessing time</li><li>Manipulate the sun by making it hop or fall to match the guessed time</li><li>Score based on your actions</li></ol><p>The game is available on itch.io and is preferably played on mobile through the link below:</p><p class="align-center"></p><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="552" height="167" frameborder="0" src="https://itch.io/embed/1597763?bg_color=ff9166&amp;fg_color=43434f&amp;link_color=ffe478&amp;border_color=d78d48"><a href="https://pigdev.itch.io/sunset">Sunset by Pigdev</a></iframe></div><p>With Sunset I also wanted to test my ability to keep someone engaged with the simpler mechanic I could think of. In the game, you tap the screen to make the sun hop a little, preventing it from setting before its time. And you can hold the finger on the screen to make it accelerate downwards.</p><p>That’s it, but the addicting part is that each of these actions allows you to score differently. Each hop gives you a default amount of points but once you hit the ceiling, you can’t hop. By holding the finger on the screen, you score a dynamic amount of points based on the traveled distance, but you run the risk of performing a premature sunset if the sun hits the horizon. The main challenge is to score the most amount of points while keeping a balance between these two mechanisms.</p><p>Talking about mechanisms, something I love to do is create Machinations diagrams.</p><h1>Machinations</h1><p>Machinations is a diagram language created by Earnest Adams to model games’ internal economies. In that sense, internal economies are the flow of abstract and concrete resources in a game. Abstract resources can be anything that is not tangible, like threat, competitive advantage, and value. Concrete resources are anything we can count discreetly such as gold coins, lumber, pieces on a board, and fruits on a Pac-man level.</p><p>I met Machinations through the book Game Mechanics: Advanced Game Design where Earnest Adams and Joris Dormans collaborated to create what, to me, is a masterpiece.</p><p>This modeling language transcended the scope of games and nowadays is used to model any type of system, from finances to energy. I was able to create a model for human brain’s rewarding system based on Jakk Panksepp’s Neuropsycanalitical approach. You can play with the diagram below. Highly recommend reading the notes on the diagram.</p><p class="align-center"></p><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="100%" height="100%" style="background-color: transparent; border-style: none; border-width: 0; overflow: hidden;" frameborder="0" src="https://my.machinations.io/d/neural-frustration-system---en-us/e1ad125514d611ed8c2902f943517e50" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div><p>Due to my desire to explore the human mind using games as my main tool, I needed to learn how to write code as well. Particularly, I got fixated by Godot Engine, which led me to create content about game development with the tool.</p><hr><h1>Pigdev YouTube</h1><p>I’m the type of person who learns by sharing, so my main strategy to understand game development was to share knowledge in the form of YouTube videos as I learn new things. My channel is small, but gave me many fruits and recognition. Here are 3 of the my bests videos, in my personal opinion in no particular order.</p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/KS5i2fl5f8s?si=EU9bS7xo_Vmz_jVs">https://youtu.be/KS5i2fl5f8s?si=EU9bS7xo_Vmz_jVs</a></p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/eHhdHgEw8VY?si=gDGl_kIW_waFmhck">https://youtu.be/eHhdHgEw8VY?si=gDGl_kIW_waFmhck</a></p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/fXQaXdWpxj4?si=X28h1b6-IxjX41Y5">https://youtu.be/fXQaXdWpxj4?si=X28h1b6-IxjX41Y5</a></p><p>Through these videos I got many partnership opportunities, especially working within the GDQuest team from 2018 to 2022. While working with Nathan, the company’s funder and CEO, I helped him create all sorts of educational content to help students learn Godot. I’m especially proud about being chosen to create the <strong>2D Visual Effects</strong> course, which you can check through the page below:</p><p><a href="https://school.gdquest.com/products/vfx_secrets_godot_3">https://school.gdquest.com/products/vfx_secrets_godot_3</a></p><p>When Nathan decided to focus on the creation of a learning web application, we saw that I couldn’t help much and we part ways. Nathan is still one of my best friends and I nurture a great relationship with him. He is the person behind the foreword of my second book, which is an honor.</p><p>Talking about books, after leaving the GDQuest team in 2022, I decided to focus on creating my own products, starting with an ebook!</p><h1>Books</h1><p>By creating many prototypes and exploring the capacity of Godot Engine, I realized there are many “patterns” related to each game genre.</p><h2>Platformer Essentials Cookbook</h2><p>The ability to notice these patterns led me to write my first book, Platformer Essentials Cookbook, a book about 12 solutions for common problems we face when developing platformer games, you can check the book’s page on <a href="http://itch.io">itch.io</a> through the link below:</p><p><a href="https://itch.io/embed/1773067?bg_color=4b5bab&amp;amp;fg_color=ffffff&amp;amp;link_color=ff6b97&amp;amp;border_color=3e36c4">https://itch.io/embed/1773067?bg_color=4b5bab&amp;amp;fg_color=ffffff&amp;amp;link_color=ff6b97&amp;amp;border_color=3e36c4</a></p><h2>The Essential Guide to Creating Multiplayer Games with Godot 4</h2><p>With the success of my YouTube content and first book(selling over than 400 digital copies distributed through <a href="http://itch.io">itch.io</a>), I got invited by Packt Publisher to write a book about multiplayer games using the Godot 4 High-level multiplayer API.</p><p>The book was launched on December 2023 and became a rising star on Packt’s online platform, selling over than 600 copies(both digital and physical). You can check the book and its reviews on its Amazon page:</p><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Essential-Guide-Creating-Multiplayer-Games/dp/1803232617/ref=sr_1_1?sr=8-1">https://www.amazon.com/Essential-Guide-Creating-Multiplayer-Games/dp/1803232617/ref=sr_1_1?sr=8-1</a></p><h2>Game Development Patterns with Godot Engine 4</h2><p>After the success of the first book, Packt’s product managers asked me if I was interested in writing another book. I accepted the invitation and proposed to write a book about design patterns, which is one of my specialties. After researching the demand for this topic and finding interesting numbers, we agreed to produce this book this year. The content is ready and the pre-order is available on the book’s Amazon page:</p><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Game-Development-Patterns-Godot-architecture/dp/B0DCZG1V55/">https://www.amazon.com/Game-Development-Patterns-Godot-architecture/dp/B0DCZG1V55/</a></p><p>When I finished writing the book, I decided to create content about game design on X(former Twitter) which I will turn into the first module of my upcoming course, First Line to First Dollar. The threads I create convey in-depth explanation of game design, backed by neuroscience and psychology. The three thread I’m most proud about writing follows below in no particular order.</p><h3>Squeeze’n’Release</h3><p><a href="https://x.com/pigdev/status/1848766140186591331">https://x.com/pigdev/status/1848766140186591331</a></p><h3>Key-Locking</h3><p><a href="https://x.com/pigdev/status/1856086258847477951">https://x.com/pigdev/status/1856086258847477951</a></p><h3>Game Theory</h3><p><a href="https://x.com/pigdev/status/1859238470796906720">https://x.com/pigdev/status/1859238470796906720</a></p><hr><h1>Thank you!</h1><p>That’s the gist of my seven years long path through the game development industry, I hope you enjoyed what you saw.
